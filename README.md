# EDA-Telecom-Churn-Analysis-Project
This project analyzed telecom customer churn data, uncovering correlations between states and loyalty, and offering strategies to reduce churn.
The project involved analyzing a telecom customer churn dataset to gain insights and
provide recommendations for reducing churn. The first step was to familiarize ourselves with
the data by importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, and examining its structure
and information. The dataset consisted of 23 columns, including variables such as state,
account length, international plan, voice mail plan, call durations, charges, customer service
calls, and churn status. After understanding the dataset, the next step was to explore and
understand the variables. Descriptive statistics were analyzed to get a sense of the
distribution and range of values for each variable. Additionally, unique values were examined
to identify any anomalies or patterns within the data.Data wrangling was performed to
manipulate the dataset for further analysis. Column renaming was done to improve clarity,
and new columns were created, such as cost per minute, to better understand price
distributions across different states. The analysis of the dataset revealed several interesting
insights. The account length distribution indicated that most customers had an account
length between 90 and 105 days, with a noticeable drop in retention after 105 days. Certain
states, including WV, MN, NY, VA, and WY, had higher account lengths, suggesting a
correlation between state and customer loyalty. These states also had a larger customer
base, indicating a strong customer presence. Furthermore, states with higher account
lengths also had a higher number of customer service calls, implying that these states may
be facing more issues requiring resolution. The relatively low churn rate of 16% indicated
that the majority of customers had trust in the telecom company.The dataset also provided
insights into the usage of international plans and voice mail plans. Around 10% of customers
did not use the international plan, suggesting potential areas for improvement in international
plan offerings. On the other hand, the data indicated that most customers made use of the
voice mail plan, indicating its popularity among the user base. Correlation analysis revealed
that the total day minutes, total day calls, and total day charges were highly correlated,
indicating that customers tended to make more calls and have longer conversations during
the day. Similar patterns were observed for evening and night durations and charges.
Interestingly, the usage of international services did not exhibit a strong correlation with the
presence of an international plan, suggesting that other factors might influence international
usage.The distribution of customer service calls showed that the majority of customers made
a low number of calls, but there were outliers who made significantly higher numbers of
calls, possibly indicating more complex or unresolved issues. Overall, these insights
provided valuable information for the telecom company to focus on improving international
plans, addressing customer service concerns in specific states, and potentially enhancing
the voice mail plan further. The findings also highlighted the importance of customer
engagement during the day and the need to ensure excellent service and issue resolution.
By utilizing these insights, the telecom company can develop strategies to reduce customer
churn. This may include offering personalized discounts or incentives to at-risk customers,
enhancing customer service quality and responsiveness, conducting regular customer

surveys to gather feedback, implementing loyalty programs, providing additional value-
added services, and adopting targeted marketing campaigns. Furthermore, data-driven

approaches can be employed to identify early warning signs of potential churn and take
proactive measures to retain customers. In conclusion, the project analysis of the telecom
customer churn dataset provided valuable insights and recommendations for reducing churn.
By understanding the customer behavior, preferences, and pain points, the telecom
company can make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction, improve retention,
and ultimately drive business growth.
