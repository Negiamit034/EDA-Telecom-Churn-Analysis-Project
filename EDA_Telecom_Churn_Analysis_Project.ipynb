        "The project involved analyzing a telecom customer churn dataset to gain insights and provide recommendations for reducing churn. The first step was to familiarize ourselves with the data by importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, and examining its structure and information. The dataset consisted of 23 columns, including variables such as state, account length, international plan, voice mail plan, call durations, charges, customer service calls, and churn status.\n",
        "After understanding the dataset, the next step was to explore and understand the variables. Descriptive statistics were analyzed to get a sense of the distribution and range of values for each variable. Additionally, unique values were examined to identify any anomalies or patterns within the data.Data wrangling was performed to manipulate the dataset for further analysis. Column renaming was done to improve clarity, and new columns were created, such as cost per minute, to better understand price distributions across different states. The analysis of the dataset revealed several interesting insights. The account length distribution indicated that most customers had an account length between 90 and 105 days, with a noticeable drop in retention after 105 days. Certain states, including WV, MN, NY, VA, and WY, had higher account lengths, suggesting a correlation between state and customer loyalty. These states also had a larger customer base, indicating a strong customer presence.\n",
        "Furthermore, states with higher account lengths also had a higher number of customer service calls, implying that these states may be facing more issues requiring resolution. The relatively low churn rate of 16% indicated that the majority of customers had trust in the telecom company.The dataset also provided insights into the usage of international plans and voice mail plans. Around 10% of customers did not use the international plan, suggesting potential areas for improvement in international plan offerings. On the other hand, the data indicated that most customers made use of the voice mail plan, indicating its popularity among the user base.\n",
        "Correlation analysis revealed that the total day minutes, total day calls, and total day charges were highly correlated, indicating that customers tended to make more calls and have longer conversations during the day. Similar patterns were observed for evening and night durations and charges. Interestingly, the usage of international services did not exhibit a strong correlation with the presence of an international plan, suggesting that other factors might influence international usage.The distribution of customer service calls showed that the majority of customers made a low number of calls, but there were outliers who made significantly higher numbers of calls, possibly indicating more complex or unresolved issues.\n",
        "Overall, these insights provided valuable information for the telecom company to focus on improving international plans, addressing customer service concerns in specific states, and potentially enhancing the voice mail plan further. The findings also highlighted the importance of customer engagement during the day and the need to ensure excellent service and issue resolution.\n",
        "By utilizing these insights, the telecom company can develop strategies to reduce customer churn. This may include offering personalized discounts or incentives to at-risk customers, enhancing customer service quality and responsiveness, conducting regular customer surveys to gather feedback, implementing loyalty programs, providing additional value-added services, and adopting targeted marketing campaigns. Furthermore, data-driven approaches can be employed to identify early warning signs of potential churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.\n",
        "In conclusion, the project analysis of the telecom customer churn dataset provided valuable insights and recommendations for reducing churn. By understanding the customer behavior, preferences, and pain points, the telecom company can make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction, improve retention, and ultimately drive business growth."

        "\n",
        "In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.\n",
        "\n",
        "For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, do exploratory data analysis to identify the main indicators why customers are leaving the company."

The account length distribution suggests that most customers have an account length between 90-105 days, with a significant drop in retention after 105 days. States such as WV, MN, NY, VA, and WY have higher account lengths, indicating a correlation between state and customer loyalty. These states also have a higher number of users, indicating a strong customer base.\n",

The relatively low churn rate of 16% indicates that the majority of customers trust the telecom company.\n",

        "These insights provide valuable information for the telecom company to focus on improving international plans, addressing customer service concerns in specific states, and potentially enhancing the voice mail plan further.\n",
        "Upon further analysis of the dataset, it is evident that the total day minutes, total day calls, and total day charge columns are highly correlated, indicating that customers tend to make more calls and have longer conversations during the day. A similar pattern can be observed for the evening and night durations and charges.\n",
